# Java Database Viewer (JDBV)

This is a Program to view databases from any IP-Address and Port.

NOTE: This program is still work in progress. Some features will not work. 
I <ins>**DO NOT**</ins> recommend to update data on the database, 
because this feature is not quite ready yet.

## Connecting to a database
When the program is loaded up, you will get asked to enter the server information (IP-Address and Port of the server).

Example server information for a database on your local machine are:
```
Address: localhost 
Port: 3306
```

After that, the login credentials for the database are asked.
If the database has given the permissions to the user, that was given, 
and the program grants you access to the databases,
which the given user has permissions to see
